# Feature Matching + Homography to find Objects
## Feature matching is going to be a slightly more impressive version of template matching, where a perfect, or very close to perfect, match is required.
### We start with the image that we're hoping to find, and then we can search for this image within another image. The beauty here is that the image does not need to be the same lighting, angle, rotation...etc. The features just need to match up.
### To start, we need some sample images. Our "template," or image we're going to try to match:Then our image to search for this template in.
