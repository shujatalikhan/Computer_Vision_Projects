### In computer vision image segmentation is the base for analysing images by converting an image into multiple segments (super pixel) or regions.


### Image thresholding is one of the simplest method to separate regions which are higher than the set threshold.

### Two broad types are:

### Simple or Global thresholding : Where one provide the threshold value as an input constant. This threshold is applied for all pixels of the image.
### Adaptive thresholding : where threshold is not a constant scalar - rather a distribution that is applied over a small window of pixels.

### In the program different type thresholding used:Simple Thresholdng,Adaptive Gaussian and Otsu
